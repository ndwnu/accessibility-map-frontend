# Bereikbaarheidskaart

In the Netherlands, we have 189,411 kilometers of roads. Not all of these roads are accessible to all vehicles. There are about 40 traffic signs prohibiting various vehicles with restrictions on weight, length, width, or height. Suppose you have a truck with specific height, width, length, weight, or load. Where in the Netherlands are you allowed to drive? The accessibility map provides insight into this question.
